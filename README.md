# Bank-loan-of-customers-analysis
This project analyzes customer data to predict loan approval status and assess the key factors that influence loan decisions in a banking environment. The goal is to understand the various attributes that contribute to a customer's eligibility for a loan and to build a predictive model that can be used to evaluate loan applications.

Project Description

In this case study, we analyze two datasets, Finance1 and Finance2, related to loan applicants. The data contained some missing values, so we first cleaned it using Excel to ensure quality for analysis. After cleaning, we performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the data patterns.

Key Insights from EDA

We examined the probability of loan approval and identified customer segments more likely to apply for loans, based on attributes like:

Loan grade and subgrade

Annual income

Loan purpose

Home ownership status

A general trend observed was that lower-income groups tend to take higher loan amounts.

Visualizations were extensively used to explore these trends and relationships, revealing important information such as:

Debt consolidation is the most common reason for borrowing.

Peer-to-peer lending offers the advantage of lower interest rates, motivating many customers to consolidate debt.

Other popular loan purposes include credit cards, house purchases, and small businesses.

Analysis Highlights

Year-wise loan amount statistics helped understand loan distribution over time.

Grade and subgrade-wise revolving balances showed credit utilization patterns.

Comparison of total payments between verified and non-verified loan statuses revealed differences in repayment behavior.

State-wise and month-wise loan status helped identify geographical and seasonal trends.

The relationship between home ownership and last payment date gave insights into repayment timelines and borrower profiles.

This project aims to classify and analyze loan applicantsâ€™ characteristics, providing actionable insights into borrower behavior and lending patterns.
